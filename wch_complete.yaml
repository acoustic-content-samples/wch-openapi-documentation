    description: >-
      Use the Watson Content Hub Asset service Rest APIs to work with assets.
      Assets are file types that are uploaded or created such as an image file,
      video file, or text that are used in content items. You can create,
      retrieve, update, and delete assets in a database. Managed assets are
      those located in the root dxdam directory as specified by its path and are
      visible on the Watson Content Hub UI. Additionally, these assets are able
      to have their workflow status managed.
  - name: Authoring categories
    description: >-
      Use the Watson Content Hub category authoring data service Rest APIs to
      work with category and taxonomy items.
  - name: Authoring changes
    description: >-
      Use the Watson Content Hub Authoring changes Rest APIs to apply changes,
      including bulk actions, to multiple types of content hub items.
  - name: Authoring comments
    description: >-
      Use the Watson Content Hub Authoring comment APIs to work with comments.
      Comments are a simple way to associate a message to an item in WCH.
      Comments are associated with a single item and user (creatorId). An item
      can have many comments. You can create, retrieve, and delete comments from
      a database.
  - name: Authoring content
    description: >-
      Use the Watson Content Hub content authoring data service Rest APIs to
      work with content documents. Content includes items that you compose in
      your content hub and upload from outside your content hub. You can create,
      retrieve, and update content documents in a database. You can also create
      draft versions, change the status, and get a count of the total content in
      your database.
  - name: Authoring layouts
    description: >
      Use the Watson Content Hub content authoring layout service Rest APIs to
      work with layouts and layout mappings.


      Layouts define the template for the type documents. They define the markup
      and how to add content properties and elements into the markup. For
      example, the layouts 'Article', and 'Event' would define what an article
      or event looks like on the web site, or email.


      Layout Mappings define an association between a content-type and one or
      more layouts. Specifically marking those layouts as valid for the given
      content-type.
  - name: Authoring reference
    description: >-
      The Watson Content Hub Authoring reference API is used to retrieve
      information about references between items in the system. The type of
      relationships that are tracked  depends on the type of item. Typically, if
      an item has an editable property that points to an ID of another item, it
      is tracked. You can use the API to fetch both incoming and outgoing
      references for any item.
  - name: Authoring renditions
    description: >-
      Use the Watson Content Hub renditions data service Rest APIs to work with
      image renditions. A 'rendition' of an image defines how you can customize
      a source image such as the width and height to be shown for a particular
      device or context. Renditions that are not referenced by an asset or
      content will be cleaned up periodically.
  - name: Authoring image profiles
    description: >-
      Use the Watson Content Hub authoring image profile service Rest APIs to
      work with image profiles. You can create, retrieve, and update image
      profiles in a database.
  - name: Authoring resources
    description: >-
      Use the Watson Content Hub resources data service Rest APIs to work with
      resources. Resources are binary files that are stored in the CMS and used
      in content or site design. Resources that are not referenced by an asset
      or content will be cleaned up periodically.
  - name: Authoring search
    description: >-
      Use the Watson Content Hub authoring search service REST API to access
      assets, categories, content, content types, image profiles, and taxonomies
      by searching the content hub. You need prior authentication to use the
      authoring search service. The authoring search service contains content in
      all states including draft, ready, and retired.
  - name: Authoring sites
    description: >
      Use the Watson Content Hub authoring sites service Rest APIs to work with
      sites. Sites are comprised of a site metadata and a hierarchy of pages.
      You can retrieve or update site metadata and create, read, update, and
      delete site pages belonging to a site. The out-of-the-box site has an ID
      of 'default'.
  - name: Authoring types
    description: >
      Use the Watson Content Hub authoring type service Rest APIs to work with
      content type documents. Content types define a set of related elements
      that are used to create content. You can create, retrieve, and update
      content type documents in a database. You can also validate documents.


      Note: Documents created or updated in the old 1.0 format will be migrated
      to the 1.1 format on save.
  - name: Authoring context search
    description: >
      The Authoring context search is a discretional middleware service that is
      positioned before the Search service. Use the Authoring context search
      Rest APIs to retrieve user targeted content items. You can target specific
      content items by providing the condition requests as filters. The filters
      that are currently supported by the API are  

      1. `accept-language` : Use this filter to target content items in a
      language of your preference.  

      2. `location` : Use this filter to target content items that are available
      in a location, that is, proximity to current location (within `distance`
      radius) of your preference.

      3. `similar` : Use this filter to target content items or assets that are
      similar to a specified item.
  - name: Delivery context search

  - name: Delivery content
    description: >
      Use the Watson Content Hub delivery content service REST API to retrieve
      published content items.


      You can use the /delivery/v1/content routes to access content items as an
      unauthenticated user or the

      /mydelivery/v1/content routes to access content items including restricted
      ones as an authenticated user.

      While access to the latter routes requires at least Viewer role, accessing
      the anonymous routes does not

      require any authentication.


      You can retrieve a single content item by its ID or retrieve a collection
      of content items by passing in

      an array of IDs. You can also give one or more field names to these APIs
      so that only those fields (if

      they exist) are returned.


      To access draft content items you need to access the system in preview
      mode. For more information on the

      preview mode and previewing in general, please refer to
      https://developer.ibm.com/customer-engagement/docs/wch/preview-content/.
  - name: Delivery render
    description: >
      The IBM Watson Content Hub Delivery rendering REST API provides
      information to render content and pages in client-side applications.


      **Client-side programming support**


      If you want to create a client-side application with Angular 4, you can
      use the [IBM Angular SDK for Watston Content
      Hub](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ibm-wch-sdk-ng). With the Angular SDK,
      you can retrieve and render content and pages from IBM Watson Content Hub
      without any need to interact with the REST API directly.


      **Conditional GET requests**


      The API supports ETag and Last-modified [conditional GET
      requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests).
      It is highly recommended to use conditional GET requests with ETags to
      decrease the communication data between client and API. The API provides
      ETag and Last-modified header response information if available. The
      client can send conditional GET requests with ETag and Last-modified
      information to validate local client data. The API responds with a `304 -
      Not modified response` with empty content if the condition is still valid.


      **JSONP support**


      The API has [JSONP
      support](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_jsonp.asp). The client can
      activate the JSONP support by providing the JSONP callback name query
      parameter.


      **Preview support**


      The API supports the previewing of content information as described
      [here](https://developer.ibm.com/customer-engagement/docs/wch/preview-content/).



      **Usage**


      In order to render content and the page structure in client-side
      applications you must to consider the following aspects&#58;


      * Identify the addressed page that correlates to the application routing
      state.

      * Identify the addressed content and layout information and render the
      content.


      With the following steps you can achieve these aspects&#58;


      1. Retrieve the site and page information by using the "Delivery Site By
      ID" API route. The response contains information to identify the page that
      correlates to the navigational state (route) of the application.

      2. The page information has the property "contentId" that references the
      content of the page. Use that property to get the content ID.

      3. Use the content ID in combination with the "Delivery Rendering Context
      By ID" API route to retrieve the rendering context information of the
      content item. The rendering context contains the layout information of the
      content item and content references, including the resolved rendering
      context of the referenced items.

      4. Based on the provided layout information, identify the related the
      layout component of your application and render the content item by using
      the layout component. If required the layout can render nested layouts.

    description: >
      The Delivery Resource Service (DRS) provides access to the published
      resources in Akamai.


      The recommended URL for addressing published resources is the Akamai URL
      which is a static file access.

      For more information see
      [here](https://developer.ibm.com/customer-engagement/docs/wch/publishing-and-delivering-content/accessing-published-assets/).


      You can use the /delivery/v1/resources routes to access resources as an
      unauthenticated user or the

      /mydelivery/v1/resources routes to access resources including restricted
      ones as an authenticated user.

      While access to the latter routes requires at least Viewer role, accessing
      the anonymous routes does not

      require any authentication.


      To access draft resources you need to access the system in preview mode.
      For more information on the

      preview mode and previewing in general, please refer to
      https://developer.ibm.com/customer-engagement/docs/wch/preview-content/.
  - name: Delivery search
    description: >-
      Use the Watson Content Hub delivery search REST API to search for
      published  assets, content items, categories and pages. You can use the
      /delivery/v1/search route to perform anonymous searches or the
      /mydelivery/v1/search route to perform authenticated searches that include
      restricted items. While access to the latter route requires at least
      Authenticated visitor role, accessing the anonymous route does not require
      any authentication. The delivery search provides access to published items
      only. To include draft items into your search, you can access this
      delivery search via the preview host. For more information on the preview
      host and previewing in general, please refer to
      https://developer.ibm.com/customer-engagement/docs/wch/preview-content/

    description: >-
      Login service offers endpoint to login into Watson Content Hub. This is
      possible via a UI driven redirect flow that leverage the IBMid UI or a
      basicAuthentication endpoint which communicates with IBMid using the
      password_grant OIDC feature. While the UI login finds the corresponding
      tenant for the current user automated, the API login requires to get
      called using a valid baseUrl (as described above).

          guaranteed to also have a corresponding object in the references.

          one is because the reference was filtered out. See the filter

      summary: Create an asset.
      description: >-
        Use this endpoint to create an asset. There are two ways to use this
        endpoint. The first method is to create a resource separately, then
        provide the resource id in the json body of the request along with any
        other desired data. The second method is to provide resource binary as a
        multipart field. Another multipart field containing any additional data
        can then be optionally provided. The second method allows the asset and
        resource to be created simultaneously. Note:- If Watson tag analysis is
        enabled, it starts in the background. Watson analyzes and provides tag
        recommendations for the asset that is created.

        ### Method 1 (Create asset and resource separately): ###

        #### Create the resource ####
          See POST /resource for details on how to create a resource.
          #
        #### Create the asset ####
          Create an asset by providing the resource id obtained from the previous step. Additional data about the asset can also be optionally provided. If an asset exists in the specified path, it is overwritten. The path that you provide must contain a leading slash. The path and name fields are optional and are generated from the resource’s name by default.
          #

        #### Example request body: ####
          ~~~
            {
              "resource": "8d21025d21e7b3595cbf630fb9d7212b",
              "path": "/Screen Shot 2016-05-11 at 6.52.22 PM",
              "description": "Screenshot",
              "name": "Important screenshot",
              "tags": {
                "values": [
                  "screenshot"
                ]
              },
              "status": "draft"
            }
          ~~~
        #

        ### Method 2 (Create asset and resource simultaneously): ###

        #### Set the Content-Type header ####
          Set the Content-Type header to 'multipart/form-data'.
          #
        #### Set the 'resource' field on the multipart form ####
          The resource field on the multipart form should contain your resource binary. The following headers are required on this form part:
          1. Content-Type header specifying the format of the resource.
          2. The filename field on the Content-Disposition header of this form part specifying the resource name.
          #
        #### Set the 'data' field on the multipart form (optional) ####
          Additional data about the asset can be optionally provided. If an asset exists in the specified path, it is overwritten. The path that you provide must contain a leading slash. The path and name fields are optional and are generated from the resource’s name by default.
          #
        #### Example value in field: ####
          ~~~
            {
              "path": "/Screen Shot 2016-05-11 at 6.52.22 PM",
              "description": "Screenshot",
              "name": "Important screenshot",
              "tags": {
                "values": [
                  "screenshot"
                ]
              },
              "status": "draft"
            }
          ~~~
        #

        #### Create the asset and resource ####
          Create the asset and resource simultaneously by posting the form.

         #
        #### Request with unique IDs ####

        Alternatively you can also make requests with the content hub unique ID.
        The unique ID is the items classification and the ID combined to create
        an ID that is unique across all content hub items.

             }
             ]
           }
        ~~~

        ## Dealing with Errors: ##

        When the request succeeds for all items that was requested, then a `204`
        response

        is returned. However, if one or more items fail an error message is
        returned.

        #

        ### Error Types

        #

        __Mismatched revisions__

        The revision that is provided of the item is not the current revision.
        Check whether you still want to proceed based on the recent state of the
        item and retry with recent revision.

        ~~~

        {
           "uid":"content:a",
           "id":"a",

           }
        }

        ~~~

        #

        __Item is not in valid state__

        Draft items are allowed to be saved with validation errors but the
        errors must be resolved before you can change the status from draft to
        ready. Resolve the validation errors and then retry the operation.

        ~~~

           "code": 20001
         }
        ~~~

        #

        __Item not found__

        The item that is specified was not found. Check whether the ID provided

         }
        ~~~

        #

        In the example that is shown, the goal was to change the status of the
        items with IDs `a`, `b`, and `c` to ready state. The item with ID `c`
        was successfully changed to ready state, while the item with ID `b`
        fails due to validation errors. Since item with ID `a` has a dependency
        to item with ID `b`, it also fails. ***Note:*** The response provides
        the IDs with the various arrays to provide context on the failure. The
        failure for item with ID `a` is grouped into the generic errors list
        since there is nothing to fix with the item `a`. Instead, the user must
        fix the validation errors with `b` and retry to change the status to
        ready for `a` and `b`.

        The status of draft items cannot be changed to ready if the draft item
        still has draft dependencies. In the example that is shown, content `a`
        has a reference to asset `c` and `d`. You can repeat the request for
        bulk ready with all three items included. Alternatively, you can use the
        Authoring reference API to check and obtain the connected items before
        you perform the bulk ready request.

        ## Requests

        Specify the items that you want to delete in the request body.

        #

        ~~~
          {
            "ids": [
              {
                "id": "579c2232-7398-4c8b-921d-3932bfc45d19",
                "classification": "content"
              },
              {
                "id": "448e8d63-ed15-4d59-85e5-53908a84ca93",
                "classification": "asset"
              }
            ]
          }
        ~~~

        #

        Alternatively you can also make requests with the content hub unique ID.
        The unique ID is the items classification and the ID combined to create
        an ID that is unique across all content hub items.

        #

        ~~~
          {
            "ids": [
              { "id": "content:579c2232-7398-4c8b-921d-3932bfc45d19" },
              { "id": "asset:448e8d63-ed15-4d59-85e5-53908a84ca93" }
            ]
          }
        ~~~

        ## Responses

        When the request succeeds for all items, then the `status` field will
        have the value `success`. If some items succeed, but others fail, the
        `status` field will have the value `partial`. If all items fail, the
        `status` field will have the value `failure`.
          #

        There are a number of arrays which are returned when items fail to
        delete. These help categorize the errors which you may want to action in
        different ways. In the case where all items succeed, only the
        `successful` array will be returned.


        - `successful` - Items that were successfully deleted.

        - `skipped` - Items which would have been deleted but were not due to
        other failures. Once the other failures are resolved these items should
        be successfully deleted.

        - `userError` - Items that cannot be deleted because they require must
        be either removed from the request or require some further user action
        before they can succeed. These include the following errors:
            - Insufficient Permissions - Drafts may be deleted by anyone, but non-draft items may ony be deleted by a manager or administrator.
            - Missing Dependencies - These items have other items depending on them and cannot be deleted. To delete these items, either the depency on these items must be removed, or the other items must also be deleted.
        - `missing` - Items that have a dependency on one or more of the items
        requested for deletion.

        - `genericErrors` - Items that the system failed to delete.


        The messages object contains information on the specific failure for
        each individual failing item.

        ## Examples

        ### Success

        Where a request to delete a content and an asset are successful.

        #

        #### Request

        ~~~
          {
            "ids": [
              { "id": "content:a" },
              { "id": "asset:b" }
            ]
          }
        ~~~

        #

        #### Response

        ~~~
          {
            "status": "success"
            "successful": ["content:a", "content:b"]
          }
        ~~~


        ### Partial Failure

        In the example that is shown, the goal was to delete items with IDs `a`
        and `b`. Items cannot be deleted if another item has dependency to it.
        In this case content `b` is referenced by asset `c`. The content item
        `a` is marked as skipped, where if the issue with `b` is resolved then
        item `a` would then be successfully deleted. Content `b` is marked as a
        user error and the dependant asset `c` is marked as missing.

        #

        Alternatively, you can use the authoring reference API to check and
        obtain the connected items before you perform the bulk delete request.

      summary: Retrieve the outgoing references for an item.
      description: >-
        Use the `/references/outgoing` endpoint to retrieve outgoing references
        for items. This endpoint allows batch lookups by allowing multiple items
        to be looked at the same time

        ### Examples: ###

        #### A simple lookup of the outgoing references for one item ####

        The default depth to look for references in an item is `1`. If it is
        `depth.reached` and there are more references that are found in the
        item, the result `code` that is returned indicates that there are more
        references. 

        You can then either query at a higher depth or query for all items which
        have non empty `excluded` arrays.   
                       
        The results are returned in a key value format with the `references`
        field where the key is the content hub ID of the item. 


        In Graph terminology, each element in the references object is a Node
        and the array of IDs in the `included` array on each Node is an outgoing
        edge to another node.

        #### A simple lookup of the outgoing references for one item with
        metadata ####

        Instead of just getting a graph of content hub IDs, you can also request
        to retrieve metadata for each item.


        The metadata returned are the default fields that are returned by the
        authoring search API (`authoring/v1/search`).

        #### Using fl parameter to request specific metadata fields ####

        Just like the search API, the `fl` parameter can be used to request
        specific fields, which include the `document` field, which is the entire
        API representation of the item.


        Note: When the `fl` parameter is used, the `id` field is also always
        returned.

        #### Using Filters ####

        You can use some basic filters based on the item type such as content or
        asset and based on the status of the item such as ready or draft. 


        For example, when you use the filter "content" it returns only items of
        type content.

      summary: Retrieve the outgoing references for an item with the provided ID.
      description: >-
        Use the /references/outgoing/{classification}/{id} endpoint to retrieve
        outgoing references for an item with the provided ID. The usage is
        similar to the batch outgoing reference endpoint (/reference/outgoing/)
        except the parameters are passed through query parameters and only one
        item can be requested at a time.

         ### Examples: ###
         #### A simple lookup of the outgoing references for one item ####
         The default depth to look for references in an item is `1`. If it is `depth.reached` and there are more references that are found in the item, the result `code` that is returned indicates that there are more references.
         You can either query at a higher depth or query for all items, which have non empty `excluded` arrays.

         The results are returned in a key value format with the `references` field where the key is the content hub ID of the item.

         In Graph terminology, each element in the references object is a Node and the array of IDs in the `included` array on each Node is an outgoing edge to another node.

         #### A simple lookup of the outgoing references for one item with metadata ####
         Instead of just getting a graph of content hub IDs, you can also request to retrieve metadata for each item.

         The metadata returned are the default fields that are returned by authoring search API (`authoring/v1/search`).

            The default depth to look for references in an item is 1, so only
            direct outgoing references are returned. Use a higher amount of
            depth to get recursive references. Currently, you can request a
            maximum depth of 10 in one query. The filters like `classifications`
            and `statuses` can be used to limit amount of data that is returned
            when you work with references.

        ### ***Search Query Examples*** ###


        #### **Using a wildcard in the search term** ####


        In this example, the request URL defines a query using the standard
        query syntax. The "name" field is specified as the query field. The
        search term contains a wildcard to match any name that starts with the
        word "Red", for example "Red clover" or "Red_clover.pdf".  

        The "numFound" property from the response provides the number of
        documents that match the query. The value of the "documents" property
        contains the documents from the authoring collection selected by the
        query. Each document is returned with its stored fields as explained in
        the description of the authoring collection schema.

        #### **Specifying the fields to return** ####


        This example demonstrates the use of the "fl" parameter. It defines that
        only the "name" field and the "classification" field will be returned
        for each document matching the query.

        The number of returned documents is limited to 10 by default.

        #### **Limiting the number of results and returned fields** ####


        In this example, the maximum number of documents to include in the query
        result is limited to 5.

        By default, if you do not specify the "rows" parameter, the service
        returns a maximum of 10 documents.

        The "fl" parameter defines that only the "name" field and the
        "classification" field will be returned for each document matching the
        quey.

        #### **Paging through the query result** ####


        In this example, the "rows" parameter is still set to 5 to limit the
        number of documents returned by the query. The "start" parameter defines
        an offset of 3. Therefore, the result of the query includes documents 4
        through 8 from a total of 12 documents that match the query. The default
        for "start" is "0".

        In this example, the query contains the "sort" parameter to sort the
        query result by "name" in an ascending order. The response includes the
        first 5 documents from the sorted query result.

        #### **Getting only the number of matching documents** ####


        This example demonstrates how you can limit the response to only the
        number of documents that match the query by adding the "rows" parameters
        with a value of 0.

        #### **Using boolean operators in a query** ####


        This example demonstrates the use of a boolean operator to combine
        different conditions in the query. This particular query returns Watson
        Content Hub "content" that is tagged with "dandelion". The fields of
        matching documents that are included in the response are limited to
        "name", "classification", and "tags".

        #### **Getting the "document" field as JSON object** ####


        In this example, the query is extended by an additional "fl" parameter
        to also retrieve the "document" field. To return the value of that
        specific field as JSON object, the "[json]" qualifier is added. By
        default, the field value is returned as an escaped JSON string.

                                "value": "Taraxacum officinale is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant of the family Asteraceae (Compositae).\n\nIt can be found growing in temperate regions of the world, in lawns, on roadsides, on disturbed banks and shores of water ways, and other areas with moist soils. T. officinale is considered a weed, especially in lawns and along roadsides, but it is sometimes used as a medical herb and in food preparation. Common dandelion is well known for its yellow flower heads that turn into round balls of silver tufted fruits that disperse in the wind called \"blowballs\" or \"clocks\" (in both British and American English).\n\nTaraxacum officinale grows from generally unbranched taproots and produces one to more than ten stems that are typically 5–40 cm (2.0–15.7 in) tall, but sometimes up to 70 cm (28 in) tall. The stems can be tinted purplish, they are upright or lax, and produce flower heads that are held as tall or taller than the foliage. The foliage may be upright-growing or horizontally spreading; the leaves have petioles that are either unwinged or narrowly winged. The stems can be glabrous or sparsely covered with short hairs. Plants have milky latex and the leaves are all basal; each flowering stem lacks bracts and has one single flower head. The yellow flower heads lack receptacle bracts and all the flowers, which are called florets, are ligulate and bisexual. In many lineages, fruits are mostly produced by apomixis, notwithstanding the flowers are visited by many types of insects.\n\nThe leaves are 5–45 cm (2.0–17.7 in) long and 1–10 cm (0.39–3.94 in) wide, and are oblanceolate, oblong, or obovate in shape, with the bases gradually narrowing to the petiole. The leaf margins are typically shallowly lobed to deeply lobed and often lacerate or toothed with sharp or dull teeth.\n\nThe calyculi (the cuplike bracts that hold the florets) are composed of 12 to 18 segments: each segment is reflexed and sometimes glaucous. The lanceolate shaped bractlets are in two series, with the apices acuminate in shape. The 14–25 mm (0.55–0.98 in) wide involucres are green to dark green or brownish-green, with the tips dark gray or purplish. The florets number 40 to over 100 per head, having corollas that are yellow or orange-yellow in color.\n\nThe fruits, called cypselae, range in color from olive-green or olive-brown to straw-colored to grayish, they are oblanceoloid in shape and 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) long with slender beaks. The fruits have 4 to 12 ribs that have sharp edges. The silky pappi, which form the parachutes, are white to silver-white in color and around 6 mm wide. Plants typically have 24 or 40 pairs of chromosomes, while some have 16 or 32 pairs."

        #### **Getting documents including all available stored fields** ####


        In this example, the query matches all Watson Content Hub items of type
        "asset" that are tagged with "dandelion". The response includes the

        #### **Searching only in a subset of all documents** ####


        This example demonstrates the use of the "fq" parameter to search only
        in the specific subset of all documents that are classified as "asset".
        The filter query is a means to limit the set of documents that can be
        returned by a query. Restricting the query to a subset of all documents
        can speed up complex queries, because the filter query is cached
        independently from the main query.

        #### **Getting available facet terms** ####


        Faceted search organizes search results into categories based on terms
        from the indexed items. This can be useful, for example, to implement
        typeahead suggestions or filter functions. 


        To enable faceting, add the "facet" parameter to the request and set its
        value to "true". Then use the "facet.field" parameter to specify each
        field to be treated as a facet. 

        In this example, the response contains the facet terms that are
        available in the authoring collection for the fields "classification",
        "type", and "assetType". 

        The request does not contain a query that matches any documents.
        Therefore, the "numFound" property from the response and the number
        following each facet term are 0.

        sequence.

        #### **Paging through the returned facet terms** ####


        In this example, the "facet.limit" parameter is still set to 1 to limit
        the number of facet terms in the response. The "facet.offset" parameter
        defines an offset of 1.

        Therefore, the response includes the second facet term for each facet
        provided there are more facet terms available.

        #### **Using the Extended DisMax query parser** ####


        The Watson Content Hub authoring search service REST API includes an
        additional query parser that supports more parameters than the standard
        query parser used in the previous examples.


        In this example, the "defType" parameter tells the service to use the
        "edismax" query parser. The query that matches the term "content" or
        "asset" is performed on the query field "classification" that is
        specified using the "qf" parameter.  

        The response includes a maximum of 1 document as per "rows" parameter.

            specify a general limit of 10 terms for all facet fields and a
            specific limit of 5 terms for only the "category" facet field, use
            "facet.limit=10" and "f.category.facet.limit=5".

        Use this endpoint to create a page in a specified site. The body of the
        request should contain the metadata for the new page.

        This metadata should include the page 'name', optional 'position'
        relative to its peers and the 'contentId' or 'contentTypeId'.

        Specify 'contentId' to associate an existing content item with the page
        or specify 'contentTypeId' to create an empty content item using the
        specified content type.

        The 'position' field is optional, value is an integer value starting at
        0. If not set position is set to the last sibling position.

        The 'layoutId' field is also optional. If not set the selected layout
        for the new content item will be the default layout mapped to the
        specified content type.

        If the 'layoutId' field is specified it must be the ID of an existing
        layout. If the specified layout is not mapped to the content type then
        the default layout mapped to the content type will be used instead.

        Use this endpoint to move a page. The body of the request should be
        empty.

        The query parameters should include the 'sourceId', 'sourceRev',
        'targetPosition', the optional 'targetId' and 'targetRev'.

        `sourceId` and `sourceRev` relate to the page to be moved.

        `targetId` and `targetRev` relate to the destination parent page.  These
        are optional parameters, if not set it means the source page is to be
        moved to the site root.

        The `targetPosition` field is required, it is an integer value starting
        at 0. It cannot exceed the number of child pages of the destination
        parent page.

        If the move is successful, then the response body JSON object will
        contain the id and rev of the updated destination parent page
        (`targetId`), except in the case of moving to the site root then the
        response body is an empty JSON object.

        A refresh of the page hierarchy is recommended after moving a page to a
        different parent page.

      description: >-
        Use the /authoring/v1/contextualsearch endpoint to retrieve contextual
        search results from the authoring collection based on the passed
        filters.

        See the Authoring Search documents on the Watson Content Hub API for
        details of the main search service parameters.

        #### Current filters

        * `accept-language` Searches for content with matching languages. If
        this filter is specified the `accept-language` request header must be
        specified with the ordered list of languages to search with. The search
        iterates through all of the languages in order until a language returns
        one or more matching content items or the service has completed the
        search for all the languages without finding any results. If the search
        returns content items the response header `content-language` is set to
        the language that returned those content items, otherwise this header is
        not returned in the response.

        * `proximity` Searches for content located within a certain radius of a
        specified location. `proximity` is used in combination with `distance`
        which is the bounding radius around the location. You can specify the
        location with the `position` parameter. If the parameter is not provided
        the location is read from the `X-Akamai-Edgescape` header. If the
        distance parameter is not provided distance is defaulted to 5.

        * `similar` Searches for content or assets that are similar to a
        specified item. `similar` uses the tags added by Watson, a user, or
        included in the asset, such as image metadata tags to search. The
        content and assets with matching tags to the specified item are
        returned. Based on the number of tags that match a 'score' is calculated
        for each content and asset, the bigger the number of matching tags the
        higher the score. The results are returned as an ordered array response
        that starts with items with the highest `score` and lists them in a
        descending order. Note: Since the specified item in the query would be a
        perfect match, it is not returned as a result.

        #### Examples

        * **Search by proximity by using user's location:**  

        `q`=type:article&`fl`=description&`filter`=proximity&`distance`=50  

        Searches all content of the type `article` and returns items that are
        found within 50 km of user's location.



        * **Search by proximity by providing a location:**  

        `q`=type:article&`fl`=description&`filter`=proximity&`distance`=50&`position`=37.25,-5.796  

        Searches all content of the type `article` and returns items that are
        found within 50 km of the location that is specifed in the `position`
        parameter.



        * **Search by language (setting the `accept-language` request
        header):**  

        `q`=type:article&`fl`=description&`filter`=accept-language  

        `accept-language` de  

        Searches all content of the type `article` and returns items where the
        language is set to `German [de]`.



        * **Search by language with ordered language list (setting the
        `accept-language` request header):**  

        `q`=type:article&`fl`=description&`filter`=accept-language  

        `accept-language` en,de;q=0.5  

        Searches all content of the type 'article` and returns items where the
        language is set to `English [en]`. Then, proceeds to search all content
        of the type `article` for `German [de]` if no content is found for
        `English`.

        The search returns images that are similar to the item with the
        specified ID (`similar-source-id`) and classification
        (`similar-source-classification`). The results are sorted in order of
        ascending last modified date.

        `accept-language` en,de;q=0.5  

        Searches all content of the type `article` and returns items where the
        language is set to `English [en]` and the `location` is within a 5 km
        radius around the coordinates 0-degrees latitude and 0-degrees
        longitude. Then, proceeds to search all content of the type article for
        `German [de]` and `location` within a 5 km radius around the coordinates
        0-degrees latitude and 0-degrees longitude if no content is found for
        `English` based search.



        * **Apply similar, location, and language filters (setting the
        `accept-language` request header):**

      summary: Retrieve contextual search results from the delivery collection
      description: >-
        Use the /delivery/v1/contextualsearch endpoint to retrieve contextual
        search results from the delivery collection based on the passed filters.

        See the Delivery Search documents on the Watson Content Hub API for
        details of the main search service parameters.

        #### Current filters

        * `accept-language` Searches for content with matching languages. If
        this filter is specified the `accept-language` request header must be
        specified with the ordered list of languages to search with. The search
        iterates through all of the languages in order until a language returns
        one or more matching content items or the service has completed the
        search for all the languages without finding any results. If the search
        returns content items the response header `content-language` is set to
        the language that returned those content items, otherwise this header is
        not returned in the response.

        * `proximity` Searches for content located within a certain radius of a
        specified location. `proximity` is used in combination with `distance`
        which is the bounding radius around the location. You can specify the
        location with the `position` parameter. If the parameter is not provided
        the location is read from the `X-Akamai-Edgescape` header. If the
        distance parameter is not provided distance is defaulted to 5.

        * `similar` Searches for content or assets that are similar to a
        specified item. `similar` uses the tags added by Watson, a user, or
        included in the asset, such as image metadata tags to search. The
        content and assets with matching tags to the specified item are
        returned. Based on the number of tags that match a 'score' is calculated
        for each content and asset, the bigger the number of matching tags the
        higher the score. The results are returned as an ordered array response
        that starts with items with the highest `score` and lists them in a
        descending order. Note: Since the specified item in the query would be a
        perfect match, it is not returned as a result.

        #### Examples

        * **Search by proximity by using user's location:**  

        `q`=type:article&`fl`=description&`filter`=proximity&`distance`=50  

        Searches all content of the type `article` and returns items that are
        found within 50 km of user's location.



        * **Search by proximity by providing a location:**  

        `q`=type:article&`fl`=description&`filter`=proximity&`distance`=50&`position`=37.25,-5.796  

        Searches all content of the type `article` and returns items that are
        found within 50 km of the location that is specifed in the `position`
        parameter.



        * **Search by language (setting the `accept-language` request
        header):**  

        `q`=type:article&`fl`=description&`filter`=accept-language  

        `accept-language` de  

        Searches all content of the type `article` and returns items where the
        language is set to `German [de]`.



        * **Search by language with ordered language list (setting the
        `accept-language` request header):**  

        `q`=type:article&`fl`=description&`filter`=accept-language  

        `accept-language` en,de;q=0.5  

        Searches all content of the type 'article` and returns items where the
        language is set to `English [en]`. Then, proceeds to search all content
        of the type `article` for `German [de]` if no content is found for

        present in the response.

        * If no fields are specified for filtering, the whole content item is
        returned.

        * The `ids` array cannot be empty and hence, there should be at least
        one id specified for lookup.

        * A maximum of 25 content items can be retrieved at once. If the `ids`
        field is found to have more entries, only the first 25 content items
        requested are returned.

        Use the `rendering/context/{id}` endpoint to retrieve the rendering
        context for the specified content ID.


        The response contains the delivery content structure with resolved
        content element references. The resolution replaces content elements of
        type reference with the referenced rendering context. It is resolved
        recursively if the resolved content structure contains content elements
        of type reference.



        **Cycle detection**


        Referenced content can have cycles. In a cyclic structure, references
        link back to itself, often through references in between. The API
        detects and stops cycles to serialize the content structure. If a cycle
        is detected, the API stops the replacements of the referenced elements
        and sets a cycle marker property instead. The cycle marker property has
        the key "$$CYCLE" and the value of the detected cycling content ID. The
        content ID can be used to find the referenced content structure in the
        parent hierarchy.

        ### ***Description of the delivery collection schema*** ###


        The table below lists the **Name** of each field from the delivery
        collection. Additionally, it contains a **Description** of each field
        along with the following information:

        * **JSON Data Type:** This column specifies the data type of field
        values that Watson Content Hub returns in the result of a query. 

        * **Solr Field Type:** This column specifies how Watson Content Hub
        stores values of the field in the delivery collection.
          * **boolean:** This field type is based on the Solr *BoolField* class.

          * **path_hierarchical_index:** This field type is based on the Solr *TextField* class. It uses a hierarchical path tokenizer to index field values.
          * **string:** This field type is based on the Solr *StrField* class.
          * **string_ci:** This field type is based on the Solr *TextField* class. It is a case insensitive version of *string* field type.
          * **text_general:** This field type is based on the Solr *TextField* class.
        * **Indexed:** This column specifies whether you can use values of the
        field in a query to retrieve matching documents.

        * **Stored:** This column specifies whether you can retrieve the actual
        value of the field using a query. The fields ***highlighted*** in this
        column are included in the query result by default. To override that
        default field list, use the "fl" parameter in your query.

        ### ***Search Query Examples*** ###


        #### **Using a wildcard in the search term** ####


        In this example, the request URL defines a query using the standard
        query syntax. The "name" field is specified as the query field. The
        search term contains a wildcard to match any name that starts with the
        word "Red", for example "Red clover" or "Red_clover.pdf".  

        The "numFound" property from the response provides the number of
        documents that match the query. The value of the "documents" property
        contains the documents from the delivery collection selected by the
        query. Each document is returned with its stored fields as explained in
        the description of the delivery collection schema.

        #### **Limiting the number of results and returned fields** ####


        In this example, the maximum number of documents to include in the query
        result is limited to 5.

        By default, if you do not specify the "rows" parameter, the service
        returns a maximum of 10 documents.

        The "fl" parameter defines that only the "name" field and the
        "classification" field will be returned for each document matching the
        quey.

        #### **Paging through the query result** ####


        In this example, the "rows" parameter is still set to 5 to limit the
        number of documents returned by the query. The "start" parameter defines
        an offset of 3. Therefore, the result of the query includes documents 4
        through 8 from a total of 12 documents that match the query. The default
        value of the "start" parameter is 0.

        #### **Getting only the number of matching documents** ####


        This example demonstrates how you can limit the response to only the
        number of documents that match the query by adding the "rows" parameters
        with a value of 0.

        This example demonstrates the use of a boolean operator to combine
        different conditions in the query. This particular query returns Watson
        Content Hub "content" that is tagged with "dandelion". The fields of
        matching documents that are included in the response are limited to
        "name", "classification", and "tags".

        #### **Getting the "document" field as JSON object** ####

        to also retrieve the "document" field. To return the value of that
        specific field as JSON object, the "[json]" qualifier is added. By
        default, the field value is returned as an escaped JSON string.

                                "value": "Taraxacum officinale is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant of the family Asteraceae (Compositae).\n\nIt can be found growing in temperate regions of the world, in lawns, on roadsides, on disturbed banks and shores of water ways, and other areas with moist soils. T. officinale is considered a weed, especially in lawns and along roadsides, but it is sometimes used as a medical herb and in food preparation. Common dandelion is well known for its yellow flower heads that turn into round balls of silver tufted fruits that disperse in the wind called \"blowballs\" or \"clocks\" (in both British and American English).\n\nTaraxacum officinale grows from generally unbranched taproots and produces one to more than ten stems that are typically 5–40 cm (2.0–15.7 in) tall, but sometimes up to 70 cm (28 in) tall. The stems can be tinted purplish, they are upright or lax, and produce flower heads that are held as tall or taller than the foliage. The foliage may be upright-growing or horizontally spreading; the leaves have petioles that are either unwinged or narrowly winged. The stems can be glabrous or sparsely covered with short hairs. Plants have milky latex and the leaves are all basal; each flowering stem lacks bracts and has one single flower head. The yellow flower heads lack receptacle bracts and all the flowers, which are called florets, are ligulate and bisexual. In many lineages, fruits are mostly produced by apomixis, notwithstanding the flowers are visited by many types of insects.\n\nThe leaves are 5–45 cm (2.0–17.7 in) long and 1–10 cm (0.39–3.94 in) wide, and are oblanceolate, oblong, or obovate in shape, with the bases gradually narrowing to the petiole. The leaf margins are typically shallowly lobed to deeply lobed and often lacerate or toothed with sharp or dull teeth.\n\nThe calyculi (the cuplike bracts that hold the florets) are composed of 12 to 18 segments: each segment is reflexed and sometimes glaucous. The lanceolate shaped bractlets are in two series, with the apices acuminate in shape. The 14–25 mm (0.55–0.98 in) wide involucres are green to dark green or brownish-green, with the tips dark gray or purplish. The florets number 40 to over 100 per head, having corollas that are yellow or orange-yellow in color.\n\nThe fruits, called cypselae, range in color from olive-green or olive-brown to straw-colored to grayish, they are oblanceoloid in shape and 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) long with slender beaks. The fruits have 4 to 12 ribs that have sharp edges. The silky pappi, which form the parachutes, are white to silver-white in color and around 6 mm wide. Plants typically have 24 or 40 pairs of chromosomes, while some have 16 or 32 pairs."

        #### **Searching only in a subset of all documents** ####


        This example demonstrates the use of the "fq" parameter to search only
        in the specific subset of all documents that are classified as "asset".
        The filter query is a means to limit the set of documents that can be
        returned by a query. Restricting the query to a subset of all documents
        can speed up complex queries, because the filter query is cached
        independently from the main query.

        #### **Getting available facet terms** ####


        Faceted search organizes search results into categories based on terms
        from the indexed items. This can be useful, for example, to implement
        typeahead suggestions or filter functions. 


        To enable faceting, add the "facet" parameter to the request and set its
        value to "true". Then use the "facet.field" parameter to specify each
        field to be treated as a facet. 

        In this example, the response contains the facet terms that are
        available in the delivery collection for the fields "classification",
        "type", and "assetType". 

        The request does not contain a query that matches any documents.
        Therefore, the "numFound" property from the response and the number
        following each facet term are 0.

        #### **Paging through the returned facet terms** ####


        In this example, the "facet.limit" parameter is still set to 1 to limit
        the number of facet terms in the response. The "facet.offset" parameter
        defines an offset of 1.

        Therefore, the response includes the second facet term for each facet
        provided there are more facet terms available.

        query parser used in the previous examples.


        In this example, the "defType" parameter tells the service to use the
        "edismax" query parser. The query that matches the term "content" or
        "asset" is performed on the query field "classification" that is
        specified using the "qf" parameter.  

        The response includes a maximum of 1 document as per "rows" parameter.

        ### ***Description of the delivery collection schema*** ###


        The table below lists the **Name** of each field from the delivery
        collection. Additionally, it contains a **Description** of each field
        along with the following information:

        * **JSON Data Type:** This column specifies the data type of field
        values that Watson Content Hub returns in the result of a query. 

        * **Solr Field Type:** This column specifies how Watson Content Hub
        stores values of the field in the delivery collection.
          * **boolean:** This field type is based on the Solr *BoolField* class.

        field in a query to retrieve matching documents.

        * **Stored:** This column specifies whether you can retrieve the actual
        value of the field using a query. The fields ***highlighted*** in this
        column are included in the query result by default. To override that
        default field list, use the "fl" parameter in your query.

        ### ***Search Query Examples*** ###


        #### **Using a wildcard in the search term** ####


        In this example, the request URL defines a query using the standard
        query syntax. The "name" field is specified as the query field. The
        search term contains a wildcard to match any name that starts with the
        word "Red", for example "Red clover" or "Red_clover.pdf".  

        The "numFound" property from the response provides the number of
        documents that match the query. The value of the "documents" property
        contains the documents from the delivery collection selected by the
        query. Each document is returned with its stored fields as explained in
        the description of the delivery collection schema.

        #### **Limiting the number of results and returned fields** ####


        In this example, the maximum number of documents to include in the query
        result is limited to 5.

        By default, if you do not specify the "rows" parameter, the service
        returns a maximum of 10 documents.

        The "fl" parameter defines that only the "name" field and the
        "classification" field will be returned for each document matching the
        quey.

        #### **Paging through the query result** ####


        In this example, the "rows" parameter is still set to 5 to limit the
        number of documents returned by the query. The "start" parameter defines
        an offset of 3. Therefore, the result of the query includes documents 4
        through 8 from a total of 12 documents that match the query. The default
        value of the "start" parameter is 0.

        #### **Getting only the number of matching documents** ####


        This example demonstrates how you can limit the response to only the
        number of documents that match the query by adding the "rows" parameters
        with a value of 0.

        #### **Using boolean operators in a query** ####


        This example demonstrates the use of a boolean operator to combine
        different conditions in the query. This particular query returns Watson
        Content Hub "content" that is tagged with "dandelion". The fields of
        matching documents that are included in the response are limited to
        "name", "classification", and "tags".

        #### **Getting the "document" field as JSON object** ####


        In this example, the query is extended by an additional "fl" parameter
        to also retrieve the "document" field. To return the value of that
        specific field as JSON object, the "[json]" qualifier is added. By
        default, the field value is returned as an escaped JSON string.

                                "value": "Taraxacum officinale is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant of the family Asteraceae (Compositae).\n\nIt can be found growing in temperate regions of the world, in lawns, on roadsides, on disturbed banks and shores of water ways, and other areas with moist soils. T. officinale is considered a weed, especially in lawns and along roadsides, but it is sometimes used as a medical herb and in food preparation. Common dandelion is well known for its yellow flower heads that turn into round balls of silver tufted fruits that disperse in the wind called \"blowballs\" or \"clocks\" (in both British and American English).\n\nTaraxacum officinale grows from generally unbranched taproots and produces one to more than ten stems that are typically 5–40 cm (2.0–15.7 in) tall, but sometimes up to 70 cm (28 in) tall. The stems can be tinted purplish, they are upright or lax, and produce flower heads that are held as tall or taller than the foliage. The foliage may be upright-growing or horizontally spreading; the leaves have petioles that are either unwinged or narrowly winged. The stems can be glabrous or sparsely covered with short hairs. Plants have milky latex and the leaves are all basal; each flowering stem lacks bracts and has one single flower head. The yellow flower heads lack receptacle bracts and all the flowers, which are called florets, are ligulate and bisexual. In many lineages, fruits are mostly produced by apomixis, notwithstanding the flowers are visited by many types of insects.\n\nThe leaves are 5–45 cm (2.0–17.7 in) long and 1–10 cm (0.39–3.94 in) wide, and are oblanceolate, oblong, or obovate in shape, with the bases gradually narrowing to the petiole. The leaf margins are typically shallowly lobed to deeply lobed and often lacerate or toothed with sharp or dull teeth.\n\nThe calyculi (the cuplike bracts that hold the florets) are composed of 12 to 18 segments: each segment is reflexed and sometimes glaucous. The lanceolate shaped bractlets are in two series, with the apices acuminate in shape. The 14–25 mm (0.55–0.98 in) wide involucres are green to dark green or brownish-green, with the tips dark gray or purplish. The florets number 40 to over 100 per head, having corollas that are yellow or orange-yellow in color.\n\nThe fruits, called cypselae, range in color from olive-green or olive-brown to straw-colored to grayish, they are oblanceoloid in shape and 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) long with slender beaks. The fruits have 4 to 12 ribs that have sharp edges. The silky pappi, which form the parachutes, are white to silver-white in color and around 6 mm wide. Plants typically have 24 or 40 pairs of chromosomes, while some have 16 or 32 pairs."

        #### **Searching only in a subset of all documents** ####


        This example demonstrates the use of the "fq" parameter to search only
        in the specific subset of all documents that are classified as "asset".
        The filter query is a means to limit the set of documents that can be
        returned by a query. Restricting the query to a subset of all documents
        can speed up complex queries, because the filter query is cached
        independently from the main query.

        days. The filter query is a means to limit the set of documents that can
        be returned by a query. Restricting the query to a subset of all
        documents can speed up complex queries, because the filter query is
        cached independently from the main query.

        #### **Getting available facet terms** ####


        Faceted search organizes search results into categories based on terms
        from the indexed items. This can be useful, for example, to implement
        typeahead suggestions or filter functions. 


        To enable faceting, add the "facet" parameter to the request and set its
        value to "true". Then use the "facet.field" parameter to specify each
        field to be treated as a facet. 

        In this example, the response contains the facet terms that are
        available in the delivery collection for the fields "classification",
        "type", and "assetType". 

        The request does not contain a query that matches any documents.
        Therefore, the "numFound" property from the response and the number
        following each facet term are 0.

        #### **Getting available facet terms that contain a specific substring**

        sequence.

        #### **Limiting the number of returned facet terms** ####

        }

        ~~~


        #### **Paging through the returned facet terms** ####


        In this example, the "facet.limit" parameter is still set to 1 to limit
        the number of facet terms in the response. The "facet.offset" parameter
        defines an offset of 1.

        Therefore, the response includes the second facet term for each facet
        provided there are more facet terms available.

        #### **Using the Extended DisMax query parser** ####


        The Watson Content Hub delivery search service REST API includes an
        additional query parser that supports more parameters than the standard
        query parser used in the previous examples.


        In this example, the "defType" parameter tells the service to use the
        "edismax" query parser. The query that matches the term "content" or
        "asset" is performed on the query field "classification" that is
        specified using the "qf" parameter.  

        The response includes a maximum of 1 document as per "rows" parameter.
